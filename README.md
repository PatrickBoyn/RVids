# RVids
A Simple Blazor application that will give you random videos, or a a video of your choice from a list. 
This was a proof of concept. I wanted to see how little I needed to get a .Net Core project up and going.
## Notes
The search currenlty is not functioning. I haven't really worked on that. 
The only link that really works is random. I just added those extras in so it didn't feel lifeless.
Though one day I would like to add the ability to add ratings to videos, and find some way of adding in outside videos as well. 
This is a project I use my self quite frequently, there are cut corners here because I am going to be the only user of this application.
I would not do this if I had to consider other users.
